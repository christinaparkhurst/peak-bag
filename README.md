#PeakBagr

Peakbagger: An individual who participates in peak bagging, an activity in which hikers and mountaineers attempt to reach the summit, or highest point, of a mountain peak by any route using only human power. Once this has been accomplished, the peak can be considered "bagged".

PeakBagr is an app which allows users to keep track of all of the peaks they have bagged, and those they wish to bag. A user can utilize the Google Maps API to locate a mountain peak and add it to their list, and then display all peaks on their list for an easy visual representation of their collection.
